 About me 
</h2>

<p>
Hi there! I am offering my services as a builder and scriper. I specialize in asset creation, level design and GUIs. I have been building for 2 years and done minimal scripting but have still had some expirience and have previously worked on genres such as SCP, military and arcade.

<h2> 
  Script work 
</h2>

<p>
  Even though I do not have much expirience scripting on roblox I am still a C# developer and know how to programme. I am learning Roblox LUA decently fast and I would say I am acceptable at it, I am able to script doors, rank locks (for example rank locked rooms which would refresh anyone who was not supposed to enter), teleportation pads and more simple stuff like that. 

  I do not have any previews of this work <b> <i> at this moment in time</i> </b>
